## Introduction

The "Virtual Teacher" project aims to revolutionize the education sector by creating AI-powered virtual teachers that can deliver online instruction through both synchronous and asynchronous sessions. This innovative tool leverages cutting-edge technologies to create interactive and engaging learning environments, making education more accessible and tailored to individual needs.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Instruction**: Tailors lessons and feedback to individual student needs, learning pace, and preferences.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling a large number of students simultaneously, providing high-quality education regardless of geographic or socio-economic barriers.
- **Interactive Learning**: Utilizes advanced platforms and tools to create engaging learning experiences.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For developing dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For implementing AI functionalities and machine learning models.
- **Express.js**: For efficient communication between client-side applications and server-side models.
- **TensorFlow.js or MediaPipe**: For enabling interactive control and real-time feedback.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-teacher.git
    cd virtual-teacher
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
